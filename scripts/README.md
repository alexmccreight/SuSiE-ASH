# Scripts

The following are scripts used to test our methods.

1. `simulation_prediction_script.R`: tests various metrics using novel data generation scheme.
2. `simulation_prediction_script_2.R`: tests various metrics using a simplified data generation scheme derived from the susie-inf repo.
3. `commands_to_submit.R`: generates command-line prompts for cloud computing for original prediction script.
4. `commands_to_submit_simple.R`: generates command-line prompts for cloud computing for secondary prediction script.
5. `susie_ash_initial_job.sh`: script to bash and submit for cloud computing.
